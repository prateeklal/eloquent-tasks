FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For number divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
